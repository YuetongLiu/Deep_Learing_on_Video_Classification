# Deep_Learing_on_Video_Classification

Video classification becomes a hot trend in current technological field. With deep learn- ing methods, we could analyze human actions, ges- tures, and do AR interactions in videos. We learnt and practiced many concepts about image classifica- tion in class, and we further think videos are a col- lection of a set of images arranged in a specific order. As a result, we want to do a video related project to both solid what weâ€™ve learnt in this semester and to have some innovative ideas go beyond. In this project, we are going to choose the sports videos in UCF101 dataset to perform motion classification task. We first pre-processed videos to get important features and representations. Then we chose appro- priate models to train and validate the data. Finally, we used the test data to find out the most accurate model. Our ultimate goal is to accurately classify different kind of sports.
